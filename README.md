# Homework 12: Employee Tracker (Employee Management System)


## Description

I created an employee management system with the below functionality:

* Upon starting the application by typing and entering "node index.js" into the terminal, the user is presented with a menu of reports and actions they can select in relation to the organization database:
    * View all departments
        * Displays a formatted table with department names and department ID's.
    * View all roles
        * Displays a formatted table with job titles, role/title ID's, the department that each role belongs to, and the salary for each role.
    * View all employees
        * Displays a formatted table containing employee data, including employee ID's, first names, last names, job titles/roles, departments, salaries, and managers that each employee reports to.
    * Add a department
        * The user is prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.
    * Add a role
        * The user is prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database.
    * Add an employee
        * The user is prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database.
    * Update an employee's role
        * The user is prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database.
    * Quit
        * The user can exit the application by selecting "Quit".
